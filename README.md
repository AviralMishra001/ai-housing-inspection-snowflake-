# 🏠 AI-Assisted Housing Inspection System (Snowflake Cortex)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-powered housing inspection system built entirely on Snowflake.
It uses Snowflake Cortex LLMs to classify inspection findings, assess risk, estimate repair costs, and generate natural-language safety reports.

## Problem
Manual housing inspections are slow, subjective, and difficult to scale.
Critical safety issues may go unnoticed, putting families at risk.

## Solution
- Structured inspection data stored in Snowflake
- AI-powered classification using Snowflake Cortex (llama3.1-8b)
- Automated risk scoring at room and property level
- Natural-language summaries generated by AI
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard inside Snowflake

## Architecture
- Snowflake Tables & Views
- Snowflake Cortex LLMs
- Snowflake Streams & Tasks
- Streamlit dashboard querying Snowflake tables

## AI Usage
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE` for:
  - Defect classification
  - Severity detection
  - AI-generated inspection summaries
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT` for confidence scoring

## Limitations & Future Scope
- Vision-based inspection using images requires `CORTEX.CHAT`, which is currently unavailable in this account.
- System architecture is **vision-ready** and can be extended to multimodal inspection once enabled.

## How to Run
1. **SQL Setup**
   - Run files from `sql/` in order (`01_setup_tables.sql` → `04_dashboard_views.sql`) in Snowflake.
   - These create tables, insert sample data, and generate AI-powered views.
2. **Streamlit Dashboard**
   - Open `streamlit/app.py` in Snowflake.
   - Interact with tabs for property overview, AI-powered inspection entry, AI performance, and all properties.
3. **Verify Outputs**
   - `outputs/sample_ai_outputs.md` contains example AI-generated classifications and summaries.
