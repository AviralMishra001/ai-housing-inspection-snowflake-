# 🏠 AI-Assisted Housing Inspection System (Snowflake Cortex)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-powered housing inspection system built entirely on Snowflake.  
It uses Snowflake Cortex LLMs to classify inspection findings, assess risk, estimate repair costs, and generate natural-language safety reports.

## Problem
Manual housing inspections are slow, subjective, and difficult to scale.  
Critical safety issues may go unnoticed, putting families at risk.

## Solution
- Structured inspection data stored in Snowflake
- AI-powered classification using Snowflake Cortex (llama3.1-8b)
- Automated risk scoring at room and property level
- Natural-language summaries generated by AI
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard inside Snowflake

## Architecture
- Snowflake Tables & Views
- Snowflake Cortex LLMs
- Snowflake Streams & Tasks
- Snowflake Streamlit

## Repository Structure
- `sql/` → Database setup, AI views, aggregations
- `streamlit/` → Interactive dashboard
- `outputs/` → Sample AI-generated outputs

## AI Usage
This project uses:
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE` for:
  - Defect classification
  - Severity detection
  - AI-generated inspection summaries
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT` for confidence scoring

## Limitations & Future Scope
Vision-based inspection using images requires `CORTEX.CHAT`, which is currently unavailable in this account.
The system architecture is vision-ready and can be extended to multimodal inspection once enabled.

## How to Run
1. Execute SQL files in order from `sql/`
2. Open Streamlit app from Snowflake
3. Add inspection findings and view AI-generated insights
